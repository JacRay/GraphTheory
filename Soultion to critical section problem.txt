1. Mutual exclusion:
 Only one process at a time can access the critical section
    progress: if a process is not accsseing the critical section it should not block 
            other process from using it
    Bounded Waiting: Eacah proccess must have a limited waiting time. It should not 
            wait endlessly to access the critical section
    Semaphore: 
    Integer variable is used in mutual exclusive manner by various cooperative
    processes in order to achieve synchronization
        Types of Semaphore:
        Counting Semaphore:
            Used when we have more than one process in crittical sectoion at same time

        Binary Semaphore:
            Strictly provide mutual exclusion 
            have only two values 0 or 1
